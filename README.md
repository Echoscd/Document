# Document
 This document include some of my project and work during my undergraduate studies. Since I majored in mathematics, I spent most of my time in reading textbooks and doing exercise. Sometimes there are some small projects like performing simulations or giving presentations. I'd like to select some of these projects here, as a valuable memory of my effort and my learning process.
